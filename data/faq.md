### I found a mistake in the course material or in a programming exercise

We would be very grateful if you'd let us know through the course support channels or via email to course maintainers at ohjelmoinnin-mooc@helsinki.fi. Thank you!

### Why doesn't TMC show all parts of the course? How can I download the next part's exercises?

Next part's exercises can be downloaded once you've gained 25% or more of the previous part's exercise points.

<span class="h2">Participating from educational institutions in Finland</span>

<notice>The questions below are relevant mainly to participants who are enrolled in a Finnish university or other educational institution.</notice>

### I don't know how to enrol, can I still start the course?

Yes you can! You do not need to enrol to start, or, in fact, even to complete the course. After the course is finished, you will be emailed instructions for receiving credits for the course.

### Can I receive official study credits for this course?

At the end of the course you will need to take part in the course exam. If you receive a passing grade, you will be able to get study credits. See the [Grading and exams](/grading-and-exams) page for more details about grading.

### Can my study credits be transferred to my home institution?

If you obtain a passing grade for the course, you will receive study credits through the University of Helsinki. A transcript of your studies will likely suffice for credit transfer at your home institution, but please check this with the study counsellors at your home institution.

If you are unable to receive study credits for the course (see the question above), you will still receive a certificate for completing the course. Please check with the study counsellors at your home institution if they have a process for awarding credits based on the certificate.

### Where do I get the certificate?

If you obtain a passing grade for the course, you can get a certificate from here: https://www.mooc.fi/en/profile/completions. Just log in with your MOOC account.

### Do I need to have a University of Helsinki user account?

No, you do not need a University of Helsinki user account to study on this course.

### How do I cancel my course enrolment?

There is no need to enrol on this course, so you do not have to unenrol either. All you have to do is stop participating in the course.
